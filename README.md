## An agency website, as made with the prismic.io single-page framework

This is a example project made by the prismic.io team as a showcase to help developers get started. By default, it consumes the content repository available at [https://frontendonly.prismic.io/api](https://frontendonly.prismic.io/api).

You can also visit the public version hosted at [http://rudyrigot.github.io/javascript-singlepage-freelancerportfolio/](http://rudyrigot.github.io/javascript-singlepage-freelancerportfolio/).

### Get started

Just fork and clone this project, and open `index.html` in a browser.

### Tutorial

Discover how this example was built by readingp rismic.io's blog post "[A website with manageable content using a Bootstrap theme, client-side JavaScript and prismic.io](https://blog.prismic.io/UzIaLQEAAGMIZ3NE/a-website-with-manageable-content-using-a-bootstrap-theme-client-side-javascript-and-prismicio)".

### Connect it to your own repository

First, create your own content repository if you haven't, from your [prismic.io dashboard](https://prismic.io/dashboard/).

Then, configure the project by changing the framework's meta tags in the webpage's `<head>` section.

Now, you can change content in your repository, and it will reflect in your local project.

### Deploying

Well, this is really easy: feel free to host it on whatever hosting solution that handles static websites, such as [your Dropbox account](http://www.dropboxwiki.com/tips-and-tricks/host-websites-with-dropbox), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
